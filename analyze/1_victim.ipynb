    "# Victim\n",
    "\n",
    "## SBOX lookup\n",
    "\n",
    "Firmware under analysis is placed in [sbox.c](../src/sbox.c).\n",
    "\n",
    "The file contains the basic steps of an AES SBOX lookup; \n",
    "i.e. step \"AddKey\" and \"SubByte\" of the first round of an AES 128 encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two classes of countermeasures are implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hiding**: \n",
    "  The order of loop execution can be randomized.\n",
    "  Thus, the probability that one specific key byte is processed can be pushed down to 1/32.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note: While a genuine AES 128 has a key of 16 bytes this victim code extends the loop to 32 bytes.\n",
    "  This gives more flexibility in hiding the actual operation not only in one out of 16 but in one out of 32.\n",
    "- **Masking**:\n",
    "  The SBOX can be masked with a one byte input and another one byte output mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "All countermeasures can be controlled from outside by adjusting the respective \"randomness\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The step of masking the SBOX is _not_ part of the analysis; i.e. this part is not captured.\n",
    "Instead it is done in a separate function called `sbox_prepare`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform 32 lookups the buffers for key, input, and working state are extended to 32 bytes. \n",
    "The last 16 bytes are filled with random values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "While `sbox.c` contains only the genuine code performing the code under analysis, further code is required to perform capturing of side-channel traces.\n",
    "This can be found in the folder [capture](../capture) and the respective target.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plain lookup**: The plain lookup is performed by setting \n",
    "\n",
    "   - `rand->random_loop_order = 0`\n",
    "   - `rand->sbox_mask_in = 0`\n",
    "   - `rand->sbox_mask_out = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "   This virtually leads to the following code:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```c\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _trigger_high();\n",
    "\n",
    "        for (uint_fast8_t i = 0; i < 32; i++)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            uint8_t lookup = aes_sbox[key[i] ^ extended_input[i]];\n",
    "            working_state[i] = lookup;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        _trigger_low();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random loop order**: \n",
    "   When we set `rand->random_loop_order` to something else than `0`, we gain virtually the following code:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```c\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        _trigger_high();\n",
    "\n",
    "        uint_fast8_t random_loop_order = rand->random_loop_order & 0x1F;\n",
    "        for (uint_fast8_t i = 0; i < 32; i++)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            uint8_t lookup = aes_sbox[key[i ^ random_loop_order] ^ extended_input[i ^ random_loop_order]];\n",
    "            working_state[i ^ random_loop_order] = lookup;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        _trigger_low();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   We realize that there are multiple \"security levels\" that can be achieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **1 bit randomness**: `random_loop_order = [0..1]`: <br/>\n",
    "     If `random_loop_order` is either `0` or `1` lookup of the first key byte is performed either for `i = 0` or for `i = 1`.\n",
    "     I.e. it is \"blurred\" to the first two loop rounds.\n",
    "   - **2 bit randomness**: `random_loop_order = [0..3]`: <br/>\n",
    "     In this case the lookup of the first key bit is blurred to the first 4 loop rounds. \n",
    "   - ...\n",
    "   - **5 bit randomness**: `random_loop_order = [0..31]`: <br/>\n",
    "     The highest security level can be achieved when blurring the lookups randomly across the 32 loop rounds.\n",
    "     One specific lookup is then randomly distributed across among all others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "All captured traces follow a certain naming scheme corresponding to the activated security countermeasures:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<SOURCE>_<SECURITY>_<VARIATION>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "- `<SOURCE>` describes the source of the trace; e.g. `cwarm` for ChipWhisperer Lite ARM or `elmohwpower` for ELMO HammingWeight Power Model.\n",
    "- `<SECURITY>` describes the activated countermeasures. E.g. `loop1` enabled 1 bit randomness in the order of the loop execution, whereas `loop5` blurs one lookup across all $2^5 - 1 = 31$ possibilities.\n",
    "- `<VARIATION>` describes which input part varies: `fixedkey` means the key is fixed while the input contains randomly chosen bytes which are randomly chosen for each trace."
